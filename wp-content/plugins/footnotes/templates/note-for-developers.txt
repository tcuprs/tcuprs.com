Footnotes plugin for WordPress, v2.3.0 and later

Support for custom templates
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

Since v2.3.0, Footnotes can process custom templates.

To use custom templates, please make a sibling of the "footnotes" folder called "footnotes-custom" containing just the content of templates/public/ with the same structure.

Existing homonymous templates on the path wp-content/plugins/footnotes-custom/templates/public/ are loaded instead of their counterparts in wp-content/plugins/footnotes/templates/public/.

The new location does not need to contain all templates.
E.g. for custom tooltips, you need only one or both of these:

footnotes-custom
└── templates
    └── public
        ├── footnote.html
        └── tooltip.html
